# D3-Challenge
For this challenge I created a scatter plot between Obesity (%) vs. Poverty (%).
1. Using the D3 techniques created a scatter plot that represents each state with circle elements. 
2. Included state abbreviations in the circles.
3. Created and situated axes and labels to the left and bottom of the chart.
